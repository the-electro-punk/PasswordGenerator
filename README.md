# PasswordGenerator

# Description
This is a password generator meant to create a randomized password of different lengthd. HTML and CSS were used for the basic webpage design/format while Javascript was used to code the program. I used an online turotial to create the code and am proud of how it turned out.

# How to run the project
Open the webpage from the index file (alt + B) and the user will be taken to the main page. Use the scroll bar to choose a length between 8 to 20, click the checkboxes to add uppercase letters, numbers, or special symbols if the user so chooses. Finally, hit the "generate password" button and a randomized password is created.

# Credits

While I was the sole person working most of these assignments, I usually received help from classmates, instructors, and online tutorials for help better understanding certain concepts
